# PR 828 Support partitioned checkpoints

[PR 828](https://github.com/cockroachdb/replicator/pull/828)

Breaking schema change:

The `resolved_timestamps` table is retired in favor of a `checkpoints`
table which can support partitioned checkpoints (e.g. for partitioned
Kafka topics or to allow multiple changefeeds to feed into the same
target schema). The existing table will be blocked and renamed to
support a rollback case. Manual intervention is required only to ensure
a clean transition between use of the two tables.

Migration:

* Stop all instances of cdc-sink
* Mark the migration as complete:

```postgresql
UPSERT INTO _cdc_sink.memo (key, value) VALUES ('version-828','{"state":"applied"}');
```

* Start a single instance of cdc-sink and wait for the automatic migration to occur.
* Start any remaining instances as necessary.

## Rollback

* Stop all instances of cdc-sink.
* Execute the following:

```postgresql
ALTER TABLE _cdc_sink.resolved_timestamps DROP CONSTRAINT resolved_timestamps_is_deprecated;
DROP TABLE _cdc_sink.checkpoints CASCADE;
```

* Restart old instances of cdc-sink.
* If the changefeed is still running, a newly-received resolved
  timestamp message will resynchronize the system.
