# PR 572 Track Applied Mutations

[PR 572](https://github.com/cockroachdb/replicator/pull/572)

Breaking schema change:

Each staging table gains a new `applied` column which cdc-sink will use
to suppress duplicate updates during process restarts. The resolver loop
continues to save resolved-timestamp checkpoints, but partial progress
within a resolved-timestamp window is handled through the `applied`
column.

Migration:

* Run the following `ALTER TABLE` command on each staging table before
  upgrading cdc-sink:

```sql
ALTER TABLE _cdc_sink.my_db_public_my_table
ADD COLUMN applied BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT false
  CREATE FAMILY hot,
ADD COLUMN source_time TIMESTAMPTZ
  AS (to_timestamp(nanos::float/1e9)) VIRTUAL;
```

* Mark the migration as complete:

```sql
UPSERT INTO _cdc_sink.memo (key, value) VALUES ('version-572','{"state":"applied"}');
```

* Stop all instances of cdc-sink, upgrade, and restart.
* cdc-sink will no longer delete un-applied mutations that may be before
  the resolved-timestamp frontier. The mutations that were present
  before the upgrade can either be manually deleted or marked as applied:

```sql
UPDATE _cdc_sink.my_db_public_my_table
  SET applied = true
WHERE nanos < (
  SELECT max(source_nanos)
  FROM _cdc_sink.resolved_timestamps
  WHERE target_applied_at IS NOT NULL)
```
